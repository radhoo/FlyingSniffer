# FlyingSniffer
Sensors mounted on a drone connected to a robust data infrastructure, for pollution monitoring, wild fire prevention and CBRN defense.

This project implements environmental sensors mounted on a drone, backed up by a robust data infrastructure, to help with pollution monitoring, wild fire prevention and CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) defence.
It's purpose is to use the versatility of a flying platform to map environmental parameters in places previously unaccessible, while minimizing assessment times.
The drone uses a long range wireless data connection to call back home and report measurements, with the flight plan being preprogrammed or transmitted via the radio link in realtime. A semiautomated mechanism allowing 24/7 operation is planned, with automated drone recharge before taking off to map the next area of interest. The radiolinks are implemented via GSM and/or LoraWAN.
The sensors include electrochemical sensors for specific gases, Particulate Matter sensors for pollution levels and wild fire detection, radiation sensors for radioactive contamination.
